## Development Process

When working on a ticket:
1.  When you start a ticket, move it to “In progress” on the scrum board.
1.  When you stop, move it back.
1.  Make sure you avoid having more that one ticket In Progress at any given time.
1.  Create a feature branch for the ticket and give it the same name as the ticket
1.  When committing, always tag you commit with the ticket number.
1.  When completed:
    1.  Push your branch to Gitlab
    1.  Create a merge request
    1.  Log the time spent in the ticket
    1.  Move the ticket to the “Resolved” column

If you get a merge request assigned:
1.  Review the code
1.  Provide feedback in Gitlab if necessary
1.  If ok, accept the merge request and check the “Delete branch when merge succeeds” option (to keep our source tree clean)
1.  Log time spent on the ticket
1.  Move the ticket to verified
